                                    The department of computer science at the Nasarawa state university, Keffi 
                                    strives to give the students a high-quality education in the computer studies. 
                                    The department offers B.Sc. program in computer science. The department serves 
                                    the needs of student throughout Nigeria by offering program that prepare them 
                                    with applied knowledge and practical skills in the mathematical sciences. It 
                                    also promotes critical thinking; creative problem solving and helps them develop 
                                    effective communication and entrepreneurship skills.
                                    As part of the mission, the lecturers engage in applied integrative, collaborative 
                                    and pedagogical scholarship.
                                    Computer science deals with the fundamental scientific laws and engineering 
                                    principles which govern the design, implementation, use and maintenance of 
                                    computer system. A computer scientist is involved in work ranging from mathematical 
                                    and empirical studies of problem-solving procedures of research in advanced computer 
                                    systems. The field covers the study of theoretical and applied principles of computer 
                                    system. As computer systems have become a part of everyday life, the demand for 
                                    specialized professionals in the area has increased astronomically. 
                                    The B.Sc. degree program in computer science is designed with core courses that 
                                    provide breadth and depth in the field along with a strong theoretical component as 
                                    a foundation for good software engineering and information systems. The program 
                                    includes courses in chemistry, physics and mathematics, general education 
                                    requirements in the humanities and in-depth sequence of specialized computer science courses.
                                    Core courses for our B.Sc. program in computer science include principles of programming, 
                                    data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems, data communication 
                                    and database systems supported by a strong foundation in computing principle such as Design 
                                    and implementation. The program provides a balance on theoretical core courses covering 
                                    both software and hardware through integrated lectures, laboratory sequences and individual 
                                    and group projects often with direct application.
